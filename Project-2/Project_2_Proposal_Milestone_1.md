## Introduction
Higher education is now a massive industry, with 20 million American students enrolled in colleges. 77% of colleges and universities spend over 100,000 per annum on brand strategy work and among those about a third spend over $200,000 per year. This has become a growing trend in higher education. Although most colleges are non-profit but still they employ marketing professionals to reach out to and engage the millions of American college applicants per year.
